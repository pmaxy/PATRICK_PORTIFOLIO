        description: 'I worked on numerous initiatives as a volunteer in the Kisumu County government`s GIS division. I mapped the county`s gas stations and gathered information on the Sondu and Katito markets for land-use planning. In addition, I reviewed the GIS draft evaluation roll for Kisumu County and took part in labor market planning. Additionally, I aided in the analysis of climatic and weather changes and worked on geographical analytic projects with Transparency International. In addition, I helped UN-Habitat map socioeconomic information in Kisumu city`s informal settlements and collected data and made maps of the handwashing stations that are already present there for COVID-19 mitigation.'
